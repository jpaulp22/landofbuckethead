                        <p>We're glad to see you! Bucketheadland was founded some time in the late '80s or early '90s by Buckethead. While there are no accurate maps of Bucketheadland, there is <a href="" title="An image of a map of Bucketheadland">this ancient depiction</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/9014144205013d2252930b8a00b34ee/Bucketheadland-The-Abusement-park" target="_blank" title="A 3D representation of Bucketheadland">this interactive sketch</a>.</p>
                        <p>We invite you to get lost and not find your way out. Sometimes you pay for a day and get to stay a whole month! When you come stumbling out, dirty and disoriented, you won't quite realize what a great deal you just got. Rides and attractions typically sprout, they aren't built. You're bound to find something new every day. Enjoy your time!</p>

                            <p>If it's your first visit to Bucketheadland or you have a limited amount of time, we'd like to recommend our Guided Tour often given by Hostbot Guide, the largely decomposed but somehow still functioning animatronic ghoulbot. Discover little-known facts about Buckethead and his park, and experience several tense, life or death situations with your Hostbot Guide.</p>
                            <p>Foreign language tours are always available, however Hostbot speaks most languages even worse than he speaks English. The Guided Tour ticket, which is not included in the unlimited use Passport, is available for robbery at the Bucketheadland Bank or for barter at the cantina. If you choose to investigate on your own, your most useful resources are the album "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7fczxHO7GneRABGdbji84e?si=PQko7544RqKismxJoCfRXA" target="_blank" title="Explore the park with Buckethead's 1994 album, GIANT ROBOT">GIANT ROBOT</a>" and the album "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIwav5D4EqM" target="_blank" title="Explore the sequel to his debut album, Bucketheadland.">Bucketheadland 2</a>."</p>

                            <p>Buckethead was raised in a chicken coop by chickens. He wears a white mask to hide whatever it is he has to hide. He also wears a chicken bucket on his head, and some say "without it, he is helpless." Not much else is known about him, though your stay in the park will help you to understand him and not be afraid of him.</p>
